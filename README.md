# Mockery

Simple mocking library for asynchronous testing in Elixir.

> Readme and documentation for last stable version are available on [hex](https://hexdocs.pm/mockery/readme.html)

## Advantages

* Mockery does not override your modules
* Mockery does not replace modules by aliasing
* Mockery does not require to pass modules as function parameter
* Mockery does not require to create callbacks or wrappers around libraries
* Mockery does not create modules during runtime (neither by `defmodule/2` nor `Module.create/3`)
* Mockery does not allow to mock non-existent function
* Mockery does not share any data between test processes

## Disadvantages

* Mockery is not designed for libraries as it would force end user to download Mockery as dependency of dependency
* Mockery can cause issues with dialyzer if you are using dialyzer with `MIX_ENV=test`

## Getting started

**Installation**

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mockery, "~> 2.2.0", runtime: false}
  ]
end
```

**Preparation of the module for mocking (macro)**

```elixir
# lib/my_app/foo.ex
defmodule MyApp.Foo do
  import Mockery.Macro
  alias MyApp.Bar

  def baz, do: mockable(Bar).function()
end
```

**Preparation of the module for mocking (tuple calls)**

```elixir
# lib/my_app/foo.ex
defmodule MyApp.Foo do
  @compile :tuple_calls # required for OTP 21+
  @bar Mockery.of(MyApp.Bar)

  def baz, do: @bar.function()
end
```

## Basic usage

#### Static value mock

```elixir
# prepare tested module
defmodule MyApp.Controller do
  # ...
  import Mockery.Macro

  def all do
    mockable(MyApp.UserService).users()
  end

  def filtered do
    mockable(MyApp.UserService).users("filter")
  end
end

# tests
defmodule MyApp.ControllerTest do
  # ...
  import Mockery

  test "mock any function :users from MyApp.UserService" do
    mock MyApp.UserService, :users, "mock"
    assert all() == "mock"
    assert filtered() == "mock"
  end

  test "mock MyApp.UserService.users/0" do
    mock MyApp.UserService, [users: 0], "mock"
    assert all() == "mock"
    refute filtered() == "mock"
  end

  test "mock MyApp.UserService.users/0 with default value" do
    mock MyApp.UserService, users: 0
    assert all() == :mocked
    refute filtered() == :mocked
  end

  test "chaining multiple mocks for same module" do
    UserService
    |> mock([users: 0], "mock value")
    |> mock([users: 1], "mock value")
    # ...
  end
end
```

#### Dynamic mock

Instead of using a static value, you can use a function with the same arity as original one.

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def bar(value), do: value
end

# prepare tested module
defmodule Other do
  import Mockery.Macro

  def parse(value) do
    mockable(Foo).bar(value)
  end
end

# tests
defmodule OtherTest do
 # ...
 import Mockery

  test "with dynamic mock" do
    mock Foo, [bar: 1], fn(value)-> String.upcase(value) end
    assert parse("test") == "TEST"
  end
end
```

## Checking if function was called

```elixir
# prepare tested module
defmodule Tested do
  import Mockery.Macro

  def call(value, opts) do
    mockable(Foo).bar(value)
  end
end

# tests
defmodule Tested do
  # ...
  import Mockery.Assertions
  # use Mockery # when you need to import both Mockery and Mockery.Assertions

  test "assert any function bar from module Foo was called" do
    Tested.call(1, %{})
    assert_called Foo, :bar
  end

  test "assert Foo.bar/2 was called" do
    Tested.call(1, %{})
    assert_called Foo, bar: 2
  end

  test "assert Foo.bar/2 was called with given args" do
    Tested.call(1, %{})
    assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, %{}]
  end

  test "assert Foo.bar/2 was called with 1 as first arg" do
    Tested.call(1, %{})
    assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, _]
  end

  test "assert Foo.bar/2 was called with 1 as first arg 5 times" do
    # ...
    assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, _], 5
  end

  test "assert Foo.bar/2 was called with 1 as first arg from 3 to 5 times" do
    # ...
    assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, _], 3..5
  end

  test "assert Foo.bar/2 was called with 1 as first arg 3 or 5 times" do
    # ...
    assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, _], [3, 5]
  end
end
```

#### Refute

Every assert_called/x function/macro has its refute_called/x counterpart.<br>
For more information see [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/mockery/Mockery.Assertions.html)

#### History

![history example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appunite/mockery/master/history.jpeg)

Mockery.History  module provides more descriptive failure messages for
assert_called/{3,4} and refute_called/{3,4} that includes a colorized list of
arguments passed to a given function in the scope of a single test process.

Disabled by default.
For more information see [docs](https://hexdocs.pm/mockery/Mockery.History.html)

## Global mock

Useful when you need to use the same mock many times across different tests

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def bar, do: 1
  def baz, do: 2
end

defmodule FooGlobalMock do
  def bar, do: :mocked
end

# prepare tested module
defmodule Other do
  import Mockery.Macro

  def bar, do: mockable(Foo, by: FooGlobalMock).bar()
  def baz, do: mockable(Foo, by: FooGlobalMock).baz()
end

# tests
defmodule OtherTest do
  # ...

  test "with global mock" do
    assert Other.bar == :mocked
    assert Other.baz == 2
  end
end
```

#### Restrictions

Global mock module doesn't have to contain every function exported by the original
module, but it cannot contain a function which is not exported by the original
module.<br>
It means that:
* when you remove a function from the original module, you have to remove it from
global mock module or Mockery will raise exception
* when you change a function name in the original module, you have to change it in
global mock module or Mockery will raise exception
* when you change a function arity in the original module, you have to change it in
global mock module or Mockery will raise exception
