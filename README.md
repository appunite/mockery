# Mockery

Simple mocking library for asynchronous testing in Elixir.

In test environment it replaces prepared modules by mockable proxy. In other environments your modules remain unchanged.

## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mockery, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Basic usage

Mock

```elixir
# prepare tested module
@service Mockery.of(MyApp.UserService)

def all do
  @service.users()
end

def filtered do
  @service.users("filter")
end

# tests
import Mockery

# mock any function :users from MyApp.UserService
mock MyApp.UserService, :users, "mock"
assert all() == "mock"
assert filtered() == "mock"

# mock MyApp.UserService.users/0
mock MyApp.UserService, [users: 0], "mock"
assert all() == "mock"
refute filtered() == "mock"
```

Dynamic mock

```elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def bar(value), do: value
end

# prepare tested module
@foo Mockery.of(Foo)

def parse(value) do
  @foo.bar(value)
end

# tests
import Mockery

mock Foo, [bar: 1], fn(value)-> String.upcase(value) end
assert parse("test") == "TEST"
```

## Check if function was called

```elixir
# prepare tested module
@foo Mockery.of(Foo)

def call(value, opts) do
  @foo.bar(value)
end

# tests
import Mockery.Assertions
# use Mockery # when need to import both Mockery and Mockery.Assertions

# assert any function bar from module Foo was called
call(1, %{})
assert_called Foo, :bar

# assert Foo.bar/2 was called
call(1, %{})
assert_called Foo, bar: 2

# assert Foo.bar/2 was called with given args
call(1, %{})
assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, %{}]

# assert Foo.bar/2 was called with 1 as first arg
call(1, %{})
assert_called Foo, :bar, [1, _]
```

## Global mock

```elixir
# create helper module
defmodule MyApp.TestUserService do
  use Mockery.Heritage,
    module: MyApp.UserService

  mock [users: 0] do
    [:user1, :user2, :user3]
  end
end

# prepare tested module
defmodule MyApp.UserController do
  @service Mockery.of(MyApp.UserService, by: MyApp.TestUserService)

  def index do
    @service.users()
  end
end

# tests
assert index() == [:user1, :user2, :user3]
```
